    "The agent measures the same stimulus through two cues (A,B) of different reliabilities. Cue B has a fixed, hidden standard deviation; cue A’s reliability can vary from trial to trial.\n",

    "What the agent does. It performs a Bayesian combination of both cues to form posterior estimates then compares these two estimates (S₁,S₂) and chooses 1 if S₁ > S₂, else 0.\n",

    "Your mission. By generating conflicts between A and B, determine the relative reliability of cue B compared to A."
